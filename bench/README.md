# Benchmark

This benchmarks the most common use case, storing paths with boolean. We want to measure wall clock time and memory usage, to improve the library where possible.

Run with:
```bash
./run.sh
```
You will find the results in the `result.md` file.

Requires `lua`, `luajit` and `hyperfine`.
